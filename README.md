    <h1>ScrubKit</h1>
    <p><strong>[ View and Anonymize File Metadata with Privacy ]</strong></p>

</div>





üõ°Ô∏è Mission
ScrubKit is a modern, privacy-first tool designed to inspect and remove potentially sensitive metadata from your files. In a world where data privacy is paramount, ScrubKit provides a secure, transparent, and powerful way to ensure your files don't share more than you intend.

Built entirely in Rust and WebAssembly, it offers a blazing-fast experience for both terminal power-users and those who prefer a graphical interface, with the core promise that your files are never uploaded and never leave your machine.

‚ú® Features
Maximum Privacy: All processing happens locally on your machine, either in the terminal or directly in your browser via WebAssembly.

Current Support: Full view and scrub capabilities for JPEG and PNG files.

Future Support (View Only): Thanks to nom-exif, the core library can already parse and view metadata from a wider range of files, including HEIC, TIFF, MP4, and MOV. Full scrubbing support for these formats is planned for future releases.

Dual Interface:

üíª Powerful CLI: A robust command-line tool for scripting, automation, and quick actions.

üåê Slick Web UI: An intuitive, dark-themed drag-and-drop interface for easy, visual use.

Built with Rust: High performance, memory safety, and reliability from the ground up.

Open Source: Trust through transparency. We invite the community to audit our code, contribute, and help us add support for even more file types.

üöÄ Installation & Usage
You can use ScrubKit in two ways: through the command line or the web interface.

üåê Web App
For a quick and visual experience, use the web application. It requires no installation.

‚û°Ô∏è Launch ScrubKit Web (Link will be live after deployment)

Open the link above.

Drag and drop a supported file (like a JPEG or PNG) into the dropzone.

View the discovered metadata.

Click "Scrub Metadata" and then "Download Anonymized File" to get a clean copy.

(Replace with a real screenshot of your app)

üíª Command-Line Interface (CLI)
For power users and automation, the CLI is the perfect tool.

Installation
Option 1: From Crates.io (Recommended)
If you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can install scrubkit directly from crates.io:

```rust
cargo install scrubkit
```

Option 2: From GitHub Releases
Alternatively, you can download a pre-compiled binary for your operating system from the Releases page.

Usage
The CLI is simple and intuitive.

View Metadata:

scrubkit view /path/to/your/photo.jpg

Output:

Metadata for /path/to/your/photo.jpg:
  - IFD0: Model = Test Model
  - IFD0: Make = Test Camera

Clean Metadata:
This creates a new file named photo.clean.jpg.

scrubkit clean /path/to/your/photo.jpg

Output:

Successfully removed 2 metadata entries.
Cleaned file saved to: /path/to/your/photo.clean.jpg

Clean Metadata In-Place:
To overwrite the original file (use with caution!):

scrubkit clean --in-place /path/to/your/document.png

ü§ù Contributing
ScrubKit is an open-source project, and contributions are highly welcome! Whether it's adding support for a new file type, improving the UI, or fixing a bug, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

ScrubKit 🧼✨
A modern, privacy-first tool to view and remove sensitive metadata from your files. Built with Rust and WebAssembly for performance and security.

ScrubKit allows you to easily view and remove potentially sensitive metadata—like GPS location, camera details, and author information—from files before you share them.

Core Features
🔒 Maximum Privacy: All file processing happens directly in your browser using WebAssembly. Your files are never uploaded to a server.

🦀 Built with Rust: High performance, memory safety, and reliability from the ground up.

🌐 Modern Web UI: An intuitive drag-and-drop interface built with Dioxus.

💻 Powerful CLI: A robust command-line tool for scripting and automation.

📖 Open Source: Trust through transparency. We invite the community to audit, contribute, and help us add support for more file types.
